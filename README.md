# BOXMEOUT Smart Contracts

This directory contains the core smart contracts for the BOXMEOUT boxing prediction market on Stellar/Soroban.

## Contracts

### Treasury
Manages accumulated protocol fees and implements fee collection/withdrawal logic.

**Key Methods:**
- `initialize(admin, factory, token)` - One-time setup
- `set_fee_bps(admin, fee_bps)` - Update protocol fee rate (admin-only)
- `deposit_fees(market_id, amount)` - Receive fees from markets
- `withdraw_fees(admin, recipient, amount)` - Withdraw accrued fees
- `emergency_drain(admin, recipient)` - Emergency drain when paused
- `get_balance()` - Current escrow balance
- `get_fee_bps()` - Current fee rate
- `get_total_fees_earned()` - Lifetime fees
- `get_withdrawal_log()` - History of withdrawals

### Market
Manages individual boxing prediction markets, bet placement, and claim resolution.

**Key Methods:**
- `initialize(...)` - Create a new market
- `place_bet(bettor, side, amount)` - Place a bet on a fighter
- `lock_market(oracle)` - Close market to new bets
- `resolve_market(oracle, outcome)` - Set final outcome
- `claim_winnings(bettor, bet_id)` - Claim winnings or refund

### MarketFactory
Deploys new Market contracts and manages protocol configuration.

**Key Methods:**
- `initialize(admin, treasury, oracle)` - Setup factory
- `create_market(...)` - Deploy a new market contract
- `get_config()` - Return current protocol config
- `update_config(admin, ...)` - Update protocol settings

### Shared
Common types, utilities, and constants used across contracts.

## Storage, TTL and Upgrades

All three contracts keep every key in **persistent** storage and none extends
TTLs explicitly, so entries expire to the archive after the network's minimum
persistent TTL from their last write and must be restored before use. The full
per-contract key tables (key, value type, storage class, TTL), the TTL strategy
and operator guidance are in [`docs/contracts.md` → Storage Layout](../docs/contracts.md#storage-layout).

### Market Storage (summary)
| Key | Type | Class |
|---|---|---|
| `DataKey::MarketInfo` | `Market` | persistent |
| `DataKey::Factory` | `Address` | persistent |
| `DataKey::Bet(bet_id)` | `Bet` | persistent |
| `DataKey::BetsByAddr(address)` | `Vec<Bytes>` | persistent |
| `DataKey::Claimed(bet_id)` | `bool` | persistent |
| `DataKey::DisputeRaised` | `bool` | persistent |
| `DataKey::DisputeReason` | `Bytes` (≤ 256 bytes) | persistent |
| `"BET_COUNT"` | `u64` | persistent |

### Treasury Storage (summary)
| Key | Type | Class |
|---|---|---|
| `"ADMIN"` / `"FACTORY"` / `"TOKEN"` / `"FEE_RECIPIENT"` | `Address` | persistent |
| `"FEE_BPS"` | `u32` | persistent |
| `"BALANCE"` / `"TOTAL_FEES"` | `i128` | persistent |
| `"WITHDRAWAL_LOG"` | `Vec<(Address, i128, u64)>` | persistent |

### MarketFactory Storage (summary)
| Key | Type | Class |
|---|---|---|
| `"ADMIN"` / `"TREASURY"` | `Address` | persistent |
| `"MARKET_WASM_HASH"` | `BytesN<32>` | persistent |
| `"PAUSED"` | `bool` | persistent |
| `"MARKET_COUNT"` | `u64` | persistent |
| `"MARKET_MAP"` | `Map<Bytes, MarketInfo>` | persistent |
| `"ALL_MARKETS"` | `Vec<Bytes>` | persistent |

### Upgrading the Market wasm

`MarketFactory::upgrade_market_wasm` only changes the wasm hash used by future
`create_market` calls. **Already-deployed markets keep their original code and
storage**; there is no migration path through the factory. See
[`docs/contracts.md` → Upgrade Policy](../docs/contracts.md#upgrade-policy).

### Event topics

Canonical event topics and the legacy topics still emitted until C-60/C-61
land are listed in [`docs/contracts.md` → Event Topics](../docs/contracts.md#event-topics).

## Error Handling

### Common Panics

**Authorization:**
- `"not admin"` - Caller is not the stored admin address
- `"unauthorized: caller is not a registered market"` - Market not registered in factory
- `"not initialized"` - Contract called before initialization

**State Validation:**
- `"already initialized"` - Initialize called more than once
- `"amount exceeds balance"` - Withdrawal exceeds available balance
- `"fee_bps exceeds ceiling"` - Fee rate > 10000 basis points (100%)
- `"protocol is not paused"` - Emergency drain called while protocol active
- `"market not open"` - Bet placed on closed market
- `"betting period has ended"` - Bet placed after betting_ends_at

## Type Definitions

### MarketStatus
- `Open` - Bets are being accepted
- `Locked` - Fight started, no more bets
- `Resolved` - Winner declared, claims open
- `Cancelled` - Fight cancelled, full refunds
- `Disputed` - Result under review, claims frozen

### BetSide
- `FighterA` - Bet on first fighter
- `FighterB` - Bet on second fighter

### Outcome
- `FighterA` - Fighter A wins
- `FighterB` - Fighter B wins
- `Draw` - Match ends in draw
